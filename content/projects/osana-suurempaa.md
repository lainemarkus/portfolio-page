This campaign and the website was created at Aalto University on courses "Viestintä ja digitaalinen media" and "Verkkojulkaisemisen perusteet". We built the website as a team from scratch using React, and I was responsible for the Visual Design and most of the Frontend Development as well as the final touches of this website. The project also taught me a lot about collaborating in a project and building a website together with a team using GitHub. This was also the first React based website, and I learned a lot during this project. I also created about one third of the copytext on this website. [https://www.apple.com](apple)
