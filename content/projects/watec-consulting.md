Me and Lilya Lagerbohm (she's great, btw!) built a completely new website for Watec Consulting as the old website needed a redo. The website was built using Squarespace. The project started with discussing with the clients about their needs and wishes to form an driving idea. We designed the look of the website together and I was in charge of most of the implementation. Although there were not much programming included, some custom code was needed to create a website that suited the needs of the company. I also participated in some of the copywriting. It was a great learning experience of building a website that suits the customer's needs, all in a relatively short timeframe.
