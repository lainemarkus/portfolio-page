Me and Lilya Lagerbohm worked as freelancers and built a completely new website for Watec Consulting. As we wanted to provide a webpage that looks great and is very easy to maintain, a website building platform was the considered the best solution for the project. We chose Squarespace as it is intuitive to use, it has great capabilities, and it relatively easy to customize. 

The project started with discussing with the clients about their needs and wishes to form an initial plan. We designed the look of the website together and I was in charge of most of the implementation. We did a couple of iterations to make sure we meet the needs of the client and their wishes are included. I ended up using some custom code to create a website that suited the needs of the company. I also participated in the copywriting. It was a great learning experience of building a website that suits the customer's needs, from start to finish and all in a relatively short timeframe.
