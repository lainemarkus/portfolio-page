This Portfolio Page is my first React based project that uses Gatsby and GraphQL. I designed and built this page from scratch and truly enjoyed the process while learning a lot more about Web Development. It is my third iteration of the page - this time I wanted to create a clear snd minimalistic design for the page. 

This page is mostly focused on my UI/UX design and web development projects and therefore not a complete showcase of my skills. As I am also interested in other positions in the digital spectrum, I am also really looking forward in learning more about PM, DevOps, IT Services and Data.
