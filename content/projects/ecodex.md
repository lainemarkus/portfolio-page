During Spring 2022, I participated in a User-Centered Design Project course in which we created products in teams. I contributed in the team in multiple different fields - I was in leading the team during the early stages of the project. I was also responsible of the UI/UX design and prototyping of the product - the graphics and prototype you see here is around 80% my work. 

The project started with defining the problem - the E-codes are often cryptic and difficult to interpret. There are also some groups that have special limitations with some E-codes. We wanted to solve the problem by building a easy application that can be used to scan the product for more information about the e-codes. We conducted user research to better understand the problem. It became apparent that the user interface needs to be intuitive and clear - yet it has ho offer enough functionalities to suit users with different kinds of needs. The feedback from other students was really positive - they found the UI really intuitive and beautiful while they also considered the application useful.
