During Spring 2022, I participated in a User-Centered Design Project course in which we created products in teams. I contributed in the team in multiple different fields and I was leading the UI/UX design and prototyping of the product - the graphics and prototype you see here is 80-90% my work. Definitely one of my favourite courses in the University, and I would love to do more of this!
