Sandbox is an ambitious hobby project with my musician friends. We combined our forces and built ourselves a professional recording and mixing studio, and we will provide both music production, mixing and mastering services as well as renting out the studio space. We will also put our skills into action with providing DJ's and other artists to clubs and events as well as creating fresh and versatile event services. I'm working on the website and taking responsibility on turning our vision into an actual service. I'm so excited about this project and truly enjoy combining my musical skills with new learning opportunities about Service Development and starting up a business.
