During last summer, I wrote my bachelor's thesis to the company Stockmann while working there as a Summer Trainee at the eCommerce testing team. The name of the thesis is "Creating Value in Agile Through Software Quality - A Product Owner's Perspective" and I studied the importance of software quality related aspects in the Product Owner role and in product management. It was a very challenging topic, as it has not been studied before. Luckily, I managed through the uncertainty and made really relevant findings that the company found insightful. The thesis was graded at best possible grades, and it gave me a broad understanding of software product management and software quality related aspects in agile context. If you want to read the thesis, I'll be happy to provide it to you.
