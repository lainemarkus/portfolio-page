During the Summer of 2022, I wrote my Bachelor's thesis to the company Stockmann while working there as a Summer Trainee at the eCommerce testing team. The name of the thesis is "Creating Value in Agile Through Software Quality - A Product Owner's Perspective" and I studied the importance of software quality related aspects in the Product Owner role and in product management. It was a very challenging topic, as there was very limited previous research on the topic. However, I managed through the uncertainty and made really relevant findings that the company found insightful. The scope of the thesis was actually closer to a Master's thesis level, and I can proudly say that I definitely did not take the easy way out with this project! The thesis was graded at best possible grades, and it gave me a broad understanding of software product management and software quality areas in agile software development context. 

Through two separate literature reviews, I found that technical background and understanding is also a success predictor in the PO role, and companies should give POs enough freedom freedom in their work to think long term. I made also some other insightful findings - if you want to read the thesis, I'll be happy to provide it to you.
