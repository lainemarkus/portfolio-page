Societal Design Project is one of the last university courses for Information Networks students, and it truly put our design and teamwork skills into action. Over the Fall, we worked with real client with a real societal problem to solve using a Lean Service Creation Framework. In a skilled team of four, we started with formulating the problem. Over the Fall, we conducted multiple interviews for shaping and validating the problem and the solution. The process started from defining business goals and impacts, succeeded by customer grouping and insight analysis. We proceeded to drafting and validating our concept, followed by conceptualising the customer journey and business model. Eventually we created a MVP and presented the project to the different stakeholders of the project. We ended up designing a framework that leveraged the Community of Practice framework to increase cross-functional collaboration and increase bottom-up insight sharing within the organisation.

Personally, a key learning was that sometimes our initial ideas need to be questioned and re-evaluated as the process evolves. We ended up changing our concept quite late during the course, as we realised with the interviews that our initial idea did not serve the customer in an ideal way. It was a brave move, but in retrospect, we and the client were very happy with the decision.


Comments from our client:

“Working with the team was inspiring; they actively listened to our needs, leveraged the Community of Practice framework, and developed the Alpha Squad concept for the company’s youth content teams. The presentation was clear, well-structured, and impressive. The team's proactive approach, project management, and the final outcome were commendable. Overall, we were pleased with their dedication and the alignment of their solution with our objectives.”


How my group members described me:

“When things got difficult, Markus was able to take control and guide the project towards our goals. He showed exceptional creativity and problem-solving skills and was a joy to work with. He managed our stakeholders with skill and respect and made sure expectations were met from all directions. Without his strong effort and output in shaping the the solution and visual presentation, the outcome would not have been as compelling as it was.”
